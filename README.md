## Taal der vormen
The branding `Taal der vormen` is my personal style, which I have been developing during a internship. When you translate `Taal der vormen` to English, it will result in: `language of forms`. Which is actualy the main concept. There is literally a language of forms/shapes. It is used in the website to name the projects.

## What kind of developer are you looking for?

While designing this website, I came to the conclusion that I do not know sure which user is going to view this website. So in my opinion it is logic that the user can find the content that she/he is looking for.

Koop R. suggested me to send only the content the user is interested in. Which is a very good idea. Keeps things very to the point. In this design I haven't implemented that idea yet, because I wanted to test an experimental filter/sort system.
