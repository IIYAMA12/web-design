## What can I do on this website?
"Order movies ofcourse!" That is what the title says atleast.

It might be a little bit BIGGER.

## Missing some clarity

This interface is missing some clarity about how to order things. A zero state might be handy in this case.

Need:
`16. A crucial moment: the zero state`

---

## Dominates on item, which becomes visible hover over it

`11. Strong visual hierarchies work best`

By hidding the image and only showing the title, it will make the item the most visible element on the interface. The title on it which is ridiculously big gives it extra attention. There is also a low visible background shadow which lift the item up.

Too much or just enough?

## Dagging

`5. Direct manipulation is best`
`6. One primary action per screen`

Wouldn't it be nice to drag things? 


- [ ] Do not show raster on start item list.
- [ ] Label. (Drag to here / Add to order list / Delete)
- [ ] Trash bin Icon might help supporting the label.
